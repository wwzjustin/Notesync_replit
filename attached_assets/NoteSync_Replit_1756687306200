1. App Overview
What kind of app?
"We're building a desktop note-taking application called NoteSync that replicates Apple Notes functionality with multi-provider sync capabilities. There should be user authorization through iCloud, Google, or Exchange. Users should be able to create new folders and organize different folders under different email accounts such as iCloud or Google. Within each folder, users can create individual notes. Notes should have basic features like font customization, inserting lists, tables, pictures, links, and the ability to lock or unlock notes. Users should be able to share notes to external services like Mail, AirDrop, Messages, or generate a shareable link. There should also be a search function to find different notes across the app. Notes can be viewed in grid, gallery, or list formats. Users should be able to create nested notes, meaning notes underneath other notes, establishing parent and child relationships. There should be no limit to how many layers of nesting can be created."
